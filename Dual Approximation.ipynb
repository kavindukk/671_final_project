Project has been budgeted for 1000 engineering hours and you can assume that as a thumb rule, an intern would take 1h 15min for a work completed by and engineer and senior engineer, team leader would take 45 and 30 mins respectively. So, the operational cost of the project is propotional to the norm of the group. It is expected to pay \\\\$25, \\\\$35, \\\\$45, \\\\$55 per hour for intern, engineer, senior engineer and team leader respectively. using dual approximation come up with a suitable team structure to minimize the operational cost of the project."
